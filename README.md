RaftProtoApps
=============

These applications don't use the Raft language
like the repo title suggests.  They do however
use the back end queueing system that will 
eventually comprise the queueing system for Raft.
These apps will eventually evolve to use the full
Raft system.  In the interim the queueing framework
will be optimized using the C++/C environment.
